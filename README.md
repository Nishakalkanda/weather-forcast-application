Introduction: Weather is something that never remains constant. Getting to know precise 
weather conditions helps people to plan out their daily schedule. With weather forecasting 
technology reaching to the skies, dissemination of the forecast to has taken diverse routes. 
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the 
atmosphere for a given location and time. People have attempted to predict the weather 
informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by 
collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using 
meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change at a given place. 
Once calculated manually based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather 
conditions, and sky condition or cloud cover, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based 
models that take many atmospheric factors into account.[1] Human input is still required to pick 
the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition 
skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The 
inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive 
computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the land, and 
the ocean, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete 
understanding of atmospheric and related processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the 
difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of 
the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and 
provide confidence level in the forecast. 
There is a vast variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important 
forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and 
precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. 
Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On 
an everyday basis, many use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since 
outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be 
used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. 
Our Weather Forecast Application enables the user to add numerous locations to the list to verify 
the weather data accordingly. The user will be able to view the updated weather data every hour 
for any given location. Some supplementary information is also presented within the app like 
timings of sunrise and sunset of that specific day, prevailing humidity at the particular location 
and rain forecast. 
Features of this application: 
 Accurate temperature 
This feature provides accurate weather information based on location. This app will also provide 
rain forecast, humidity information, maximum and minimum temperatures of the day and hourly 
temperature for a location. The forecasts are accentuated by images for clear comprehension. 
Users will be able to find the sunrise and sunset time with a simple and brief text on today’s 
weather. 
 Precise and real-time weather updates 
 Hourly,daily and weekly periodicity 
 World-wide weather information
